I found three dollar bills on the sidewalk yesterday. First I saw one,
partially folded. I looked around quickly to see if anyone had
obviously dropped it, and then snatched it up. As I righted myself, I
saw the other two, together, folded in a similar manner. I looked
around for more, but didn't see any.

One time in high school I remember finding two crisp $20 bills among
the fall leaves in the gutter in Providence. I was with my friend,
Josh, and I remember how pissed he was that he didn't find them. I
think if that happened today, I'd give half to the person with me, but
I'm pretty sure I didn't do that then. I should have.

It's an interesting phenomenon finding money on the street. One thing
I noticed: I couldn't help but look around for more. Even after
finding the second two, I was somehow convinced that I'd find another
one, or maybe a five or ten or even twenty dollar bill.
